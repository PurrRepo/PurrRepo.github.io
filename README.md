# Welcome to PurrRepo: A Purr-Data Patch Repository

PurrRepo aims to be a comprehensive repository dedicated to Purr-Data (PD) patches. PD is a visual programming environment specifically designed for creating interactive audio, video, and multimedia works. Here, you'll find a diverse collection of patches contributed by the PD community, offering a valuable resource for both new and experienced users.

Beyond offering a library of patches, PurrRepo serves a unique purpose. I'm actively building a dataset to train a language model focused on PD. This tool will ultimately assist users in creating their own patches.

Feel free to explore the site for patches available for download and inspiration.
